# animated_tree_view

A flutter package that provides a heirarchial Tree like data structure that can be visualized as a linear list view.

The widget is based on the Flutterâ€™s familiar APIs of [AnimatedList](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedList-class.html) and [SliverAnimatedList](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SliverAnimatedList-class.html) and can even be used as a replacement for these widgets. Each node can be completely customized using the `TreeNodeWidgetBuilder` that is used to build the nodes. All the mobile, web and desktop platforms are fully supported.

## SUPPORT FOR RTL ADDED!!

## Variants
There are four different variants each for the `TreeView` and the `SliverTreeView`. Based on the requirements and use case, you can use the [simple](#.simple), [simpleTyped](#.simpleTyped), [indexed](#.indexed) or the [indexTyped](#.indexTyped) variants.

## TreeView
The simple `TreeView` uses the [AnimatedList](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedList-class.html) to build the tree view. It can be used for simple tree implementations where a combination with other scrollables is not required.

## SliverTreeView
For implementing fancy lists and animations using [slivers](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/advanced/slivers), `SliverTreeView` should be used. It is based on the [SliverAnimatedList](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SliverAnimatedList-class.html). It provides the same APIs as the normal `TreeView` and its usage is also the same. The `SliverTreeView` can be combined with other [slivers](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/advanced/slivers) in a [CustomScrollView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CustomScrollView-class.html).  Slivers provide significant performance improvements over the regular lists. Know more about slivers [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/advanced/slivers).

### .simple <a name=".simple"></a>
The `simple` variant uses a [Map](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.13.3/dart-core/Map-class.html) data-structure to handle the Nodes and their children Using a [Map](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.13.3/dart-core/Map-class.html) makes the tree view more performant with a complexity on traversing the Nodes being O(n), where n is the level of the node. However the `simple` and `simpleTyped` variants of `TreeView` and `SliverTreeView` lack the indexed based operations like `insertAt` and `removeAt` etc.

### .simpleTyped <a name=".simpleTyped"></a>
The `simpleTyped` variant works the same as the `simple` variant however it is optimized for custom data types. The `simpleTyped` variant is recommended when using a custom data type and the indexed based operations are not needed. The analyzer is able to correctly infer the custom types when using the typed variants.

### .indexed <a name=".indexed"></a>
The `indexed` variant uses a [List](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.10.5/dart-core/List-class.html) data-structure to handle the Nodes and their children. This allows it to perform all the list based operations that require indices, like `insertAt` or `removeAt`. The drawback of using an `TreeView.indexed` or a `SliverTreeView.indexed` instead of `*.simple` variant is that the Node traversal operations on the `*.indexed` variants are more expensive with a complexity of O(n^m), where n is the number of children in a node, and m is the node level.

### .indexTyped <a name=".indexTyped"></a>
The `indexTyped` works the same as the `indexed` variant however it is optimized for custom data types. The `indexTyped` variant is recommended when using a custom data type and the index based operations are also required. The analyzer is able to correctly infer the custom types when using the typed variants.

## Features
* Infinite levels and child nodes.
* Animations for Node expansion and collapse.
* Customizable indentation and scoping lines
* Plenty of utility methods for adding, inserting, removing and collapsing/expanding nodes.
* Easily traverse the tree laterally or vertically from the root to the leaf and back.
* Tree Diff Util to compute the difference between two trees, and automatically apply the changes in the tree view.
* Listenable changes using ValueNotifier and event Streams.
* RTL Support

## How to use
### TreeView.simple
You can simply use the provided `TreeNode` or extend your data object from `TreeNode<T>`.

*Note: If the `key` is omitted, then a unique key will be automatically assigned to the Node.*

Finally, initialize the `TreeView` by providing it a builder.

```dart
TreeView.simple(
    tree: TreeNode.root(),
    builder: (context, node) {
        // build your node item here
        // return any widget that you need
        return ListTile(
          title: Text("Item ${node.level}-${node.key}"),
          subtitle: Text('Level ${node.level}'),
        );
    }
                
```

**_The `level` has been removed from the builder starting from version 2.0.0. To get the node level, use the `node.level` instead._**

### TreeView.indexed
The usage of `TreeView.indexed` is exactly the same as a simple `TreeView`. You only need to replace `TreeNode` with `IndexedTreeNode` or extend your `YourCustomNode` from `IndexedTreeNode` like this

Finally initialize the widget like this:

```dart
TreeView.indexed(
    tree: IndexedTreeNode.root(),
    builder: (context, node) {
        // build your node item here
        // return any widget that you need
        return ListTile(
          title: Text("Item ${node.level}-${node.key}"),
          subtitle: Text('Level ${node.level}'),
        );
    }
                
```

*Please see this [example](https://github.com/embraceitmobile/animated_tree_view/blob/main/example/lib/main.dart) for a more comprehsive code sample.*

### TreeView.simpleTyped
To use your custom data type `CustomClass` with TreeView, wrap your custom class inside the TreeNode like this `TreeNode<CustomClass>`

```dart
TreeView.simpleTyped<CustomClass, TreeNode<CustomClass>>(
    tree: TreeNode<CustomClass>.root(),
    builder: (context, node) {
      // build your node item here
      // return any widget that you need
      return ListTile(
          title: Text("Item ${node.level}-${node.key}"),
          subtitle: Text('Level ${node.data?.foo}'),
    );
  }     
)          
```

*Please see this [example](https://github.com/embraceitmobile/animated_tree_view/blob/main/example/lib/samples/treeview/treeview_custom_object_sample.dart) for a more comprehsive custom object code sample.*

## SliverTreeView
The API and usage of `SliverTreeView` is the same as `TreeView`. You just need to wrap the `SliverTreeView`
inside a `CustomScrollView` and provide it a `Tree` and a builder.

```dart
CustomScrollView(
    slivers: [
      SliverTreeView.simple(
        tree: TreeNode.root(),
        builder: (context, node) {
          // build your node item here
          // return any widget that you need
          return ListTile(
            title: Text("Item ${node.level}-${node.key}"),
            subtitle: Text('Level ${node.level}'),
          );
        },
      ),
    ],
  );
```

*Please see this [example](https://github.com/embraceitmobile/animated_tree_view/blob/main/example/lib/samples/sliver_treeview/sliver_treeview_sample.dart) for a more comprehsive sliver treeview sample.*

## ExpansionBehavior <a name="expansionBehavior"></a>
The `ExpansionBehavior` provides control over the behavior of the node when it is expanded.
There are five available ExpansionBehaviors to choose from.

**Note: For using an `ExpansionBehavior` with a `SliverTreeView`, the same instance of an [AutoScrollController](https://pub.dev/documentation/scroll_to_index/latest/scroll_to_index/AutoScrollController-class.html)
needs to be provided to `SliverTreeView` and the `CustoScrollView`.

| `ExpansionBehavior.none`                                                                                         | `ExpansionBehavior.snapToTop`                                                                                                                    | `ExpansionBehavior.scrollToLastChild`                                                                                                               | `ExpansionBehavior.collapseOthers`                                                                                             | `ExpansionBehavior.collapseOthersAndSnapToTop`                                                                                                                            | 
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No additional action will be taken on node expansion.                                                            | The expanded node will be snapped to the top of the list. This ensures that the expanded node is always visible with maximum number of children. | The list will be scrolled to the last child of the node if it is not already visible on screen. This ensures that the last child is always visible. | Collapse all other nodes, only the current node will remain expanded. This ensures that only one node is expanded at one time. | Collapse all other nodes, only the current node will remain expanded, also snap the node to the top of the list. This ensures that only one node is expanded at one time. |

## ExpansionIndicator <a name="expansionIndicator"></a>
The expansion indicator animates to change it's state based on the whether the node is collapsed or expanded. There are several built-in expansion indicators.

| `ChevronIndicator.rightDown`                                                        | `ChevronIndicator.upDown`                                                        | `PlusMinusIndicator`                                                                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![Right down indicator](https://media.giphy.com/media/aAy5CCdCj3ruNqq1aG/giphy.gif) | ![Up down indicator](https://media.giphy.com/media/t0jK0Xm7rQ2uEEeDFi/giphy.gif) | ![Plus minus indicator](https://media.giphy.com/media/uw9HpEhBqVpn5wsDpq/giphy.gif) |

`noExpansionIndicatorBuilder` can be used when no indicator is required.

`ExpansionIndicator` class can be extended to create a fully customizable expansion indicator.

## Indentation <a name="indentation"></a>
The indentations are drawn to show the node level and the connections between different nodes. The lineWidth, color and offset of the indentation can be customized with the `Indentation`.

By default `IndentStyle.none` is used and indentation lines are not drawn. Only the `indentation.width` will be used to add padding to the start of the content.

 To draw indents change the style to `IndentStyle.squareJoint` or `IndentStyle.roundJoint`.
 To draw only scoping lines, change the style to `IndentStyle.scopingLine`.

| `IndentStyle.squareJoint`                              | `IndentStyle.roundJoint`                               | `IndentStyle.scopingLines`                             | `IndentStyle.none`                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

## Tree Diff Util <a name="treeDiffUtil"></a>
A `TreeDiffUtil` is used to determine the difference between two trees if the `tree` is updated using any state management tool like setState or Bloc etc.

For `TreeView.simple`, which uses a `Map` internally to store the child nodes, this is a simple difference operation on all the nodes of the tree. Complexity is O(2n), where n is the total number of nodes in the tree.

For `TreeView.indexed`, which uses a `List` internally to store the child nodes, it is a little more complex as Myer's algorithm is used to determine the difference in the children of each respective node. Complexity is O(N + D^2), where D is the length of the edit script. For more details see [diffutil_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/diffutil_dart).
